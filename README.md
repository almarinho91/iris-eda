# 🌸 Iris Dataset – Data Science and analysis

This project is a complete walkthrough of the **data science workflow** using the classic Iris flower dataset. It includes data inspection, statistics, visualizations, hypothesis testing, and classification with machine learning models — all presented in a clean, well-documented notebook.

> **Author:** André Lopes Marinho  
> **Goal:** Build and explain a data science pipeline from data exploration to predictive modeling using Python.

## 📘 What's Inside the Notebook

The notebook `iris_eda.ipynb` includes:

### 🧠 Analysis & Exploration

- Dataset structure and inspection with `pandas`
- Descriptive statistics: mean, median, mode, variance, std deviation
- Visual exploration using histograms, boxplots, violin plots, pairplots

### 📐 Statistical Inference

- Two-sample t-tests
- Confidence intervals
- Insights into feature differences between species

### 🤖 Machine Learning

- Feature selection and model training
- Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree
- Evaluation with accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- 5-fold cross-validation for generalization

### ✅ Key Results

- **Best feature for classification:** petal length & petal width
- **Highest accuracy:** KNN (100% on test set), Logistic Regression (97%)
- **Setosa** is perfectly separable; Versicolor and Virginica overlap slightly
- Visual and statistical insights are consistent
