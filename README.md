# 🌸 Iris Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Welcome to the first project in my data science learning portfolio. In this notebook, I explore the famous **Iris dataset** using Python and foundational statistics. This analysis covers data inspection, descriptive statistics, and interpretation of results.

> **Author:** André Lopes Marinho  
> **Goal:** Apply descriptive statistical techniques and communicate findings clearly using code, markdown, and visualizations.

## 📚 Learning Objectives

By the end of this notebook, you will understand:

- ✅ How to inspect and understand a real-world dataset using `pandas`
- ✅ How to compute key descriptive statistics:
  - Mean, Median, Mode
  - Variance, Standard Deviation
- ✅ The differences between **sample** and **population** statistics
- ✅ How to interpret these metrics to identify useful features
- ✅ How to structure a clean and readable data science notebook

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The **Iris dataset** is a classic in machine learning and statistics. It includes **150 samples** from **three iris species**:
- *Iris setosa*
- *Iris versicolor*
- *Iris virginica*

Each sample includes four numeric features:
- `sepal_length`
- `sepal_width`
- `petal_length`
- `petal_width`
